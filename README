CalculatorD
===========
This is a basic calculator (with GUI) written in Java.
Using the latest version of Sun Java is recommended.

CalculatorD provided as-is for entertainment/educational use only.  Personally, I would not recommend doing any sort of government/financial work using this (at least not at this point).

Using the Program
=================
If you are not a developer, I encourage you to download 'CalculatorD.jar' and use that.

On most Windows systems, you can double-click on this jar file to run the program.  Piece of cake.

On other systems, open your terminal, cd to the directory that you placed 'CalculatorD.jar' in and run the following command:
java -jar Calculator.jar

On any system where CalculatorD works, the program generates a file by the name of 'CalculatorOptions.cfg' in the same directory as 'CalculatorD.jar'.  This file stores program options that you can set from within the program.

If you're a developer, you can use the provided makefile (or the provided Ant build.xml) to compile, generate documentation, and all sorts of other fun stuff.
