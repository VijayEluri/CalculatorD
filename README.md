CalculatorD
===========
This is a basic calculator (with GUI) written in Java. Using the latest version of Sun Java is recommended.

CalculatorD provides accurate calculations from my testing, but I must stress that CalculatorD provided as-is.

Using the Program
=================
If you are not a developer, I encourage you to download `CalculatorD.jar` and use that.  `CalculatorD.jar` can be found on my [website](http://www.dustin-leavins.info/programming.php) ([direct download link](http://www.dustin-leavins.info/CalculatorD-1.0.jar)).

On most systems (including Windows), you can double-click on this jar file to run the program.

You can run CalculatorD through the command line\terminal with the following command:
`java -jar Calculator.jar`

The program generates a file by the name of `CalculatorOptions.cfg` in the same directory as `CalculatorD.jar`.  This file stores program options that you can set from within the program.

This project uses Maven, so developers can use it to build the project and run tests.
