CalculatorD
===========
This is a basic calculator (with GUI) written in Java.
Using the latest version of Sun Java is recommended.

CalculatorD provided as-is for entertainment/educational use only.  Personally, I would not recommend doing any sort of government/financial work using this (at least not at this point).

Using the Program
=================
If you are not a developer, I encourage you to download `CalculatorD.jar` and use that.  `CalculatorD.jar` can be found on my [website](http://www.dustin-leavins.info/programming.php) ([direct download link](http://www.dustin-leavins.info/CalculatorD.jar)).

On most Windows systems, you can double-click on this jar file to run the program.  Piece of cake.

On other systems, open your terminal, cd to the directory that you placed `CalculatorD.jar` in and run the following command:

`java -jar Calculator.jar`

On any system where CalculatorD works, the program generates a file by the name of `CalculatorOptions.cfg` in the same directory as `CalculatorD.jar`.  This file stores program options that you can set from within the program.

If you're a developer, this project uses Maven.
